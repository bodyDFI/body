# Shared Components

This directory contains shared resources and components used across the bodyDFI platform.

## Structure

- `locales/`: Internationalization resources and translations
- `config/`: Configuration files and environment settings
- `types/`: Shared TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- `constants/`: Global constants and configuration values

## Development Guidelines

1. Keep shared components focused on reusability
2. Avoid business logic in shared components
3. Document all exports and interfaces
4. Maintain backward compatibility when updating shared components
